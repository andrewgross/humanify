# Exp016 round 1 — reroll eliminated, votes pin drifted names (2026-07-09)

Branch `exp016-diff-noise-convergence`, run artifacts `/tmp/exp016-r1/`.
Fixes under test: binding-keyed statement-align (`c1fb8b9`), classes in
the module pool (`25b8ae5`), function-name votes (`ebb565c`), plus the
exp015-tail MF5 blob cap.

## What the fixes did (verified in the run)

- **`function serializeWithLengthLimit` is IDENTICAL in both legs** —
  the flagship 423-occurrence binding (five different names in five
  runs) is pinned by caller votes. 100 function names propagated via
  votes in the incremental leg; the family dropped 1,470 → 784, and
  what remains is mostly sub-floor (single-voter / unmatched-caller)
  cases plus asymmetric coverage gaps.
- **Classes:** 2,465 module-binding propagations now include the class
  population; `y6→C6`/`HK→qK`/`m3→a3` are gone. Residual 230 occ =
  first-contact naming drift (`BasePatternMatcher→PatternMatcher`) and
  a handful of still-minified pairs.
- **Reroll is effectively closed** (139 occ / 61 bindings, was 7,350 at
  the exp014 phase-6 baseline). Megafunction-range noise is down to
  1,013 occurrences, mostly transfer-gap naming drift now.
- **Run health:** parse + invariant clean; genuine 1,919; ZERO
  context-length failures in either leg (first fully clean run — the
  MF5 blob cap closed the last one; fresh-leg module "not renamed"
  dropped 26 → 16). Cost: fresh 44.6M tokens / 11m38s (cheapest yet),
  incremental **3.7M / 3m57s** (round-3 exp014 was 5.9M / 8m27s — the
  mechanical-transfer share keeps growing).

## What remains (7,757 occurrences)

The top of the noise list is now entirely LLM naming instability:

1. **Decoration/collision flips** — `error→errorVal`,
   `identityRef→identityVal`, `configVar→config`,
   `appStateVal→appStateVar`, `hashAlgorithmsVal→hashAlgorithmsVar`.
   Likely collision-suffix order-dependence (which binding wins the
   bare name differs per leg), not LLM whim — needs an autopsy before
   fixing.
2. **Ordinal churn on repeated base names** — `reactInstance28→React95`,
   `reactLib124→ink8`: collision ordinals assigned by naming-completion
   order, which is racy across legs.
3. **Synonym drift on close matches** — `userQueryMessageItem→messageItem`,
   `JsonRpcSchema→rpcRequestSchema` (the case-flip schema family).
4. **Asymmetric 1,106** — `index→i`, `processMessageVal→q`,
   `handleKeyEvent→c_`: one leg named, the other left minified —
   v120-side coverage holes to autopsy (which pass dropped them).
5. The deep reservoir: 4,111 fresh-pool v120 functions with exact hash
   twins stuck in m:n ambiguous buckets (exp014's cracking problem) —
   every one of them is a freshly-named function whose locals all
   drift. The biggest structural lever left.

## Round 2 — the metric that matches the goal, and prior-name snapping

**Decoration-flip autopsy** (`error→errorVal`): v119 fresh named it
`error` in round 1; v120 incremental named it `errorVal` in round 2 —
a RETRY after the suggestion `error` collided with a prior name already
transferred into the same function. The fresh leg never has that
collision landscape. Conclusion: much of the fresh-vs-incremental A/B's
noise is FIRST-CONTACT — one-time choices the production chain
inherits, not re-makes.

**Shared-lineage protocol** (`run-chain.sh`): the goal is reviewing
SUBSEQUENT-release diffs, where every release is humanified
incrementally on the previous one. v118 was never binary-decompiled,
so the lineage pair closes the loop: re-humanify v119 with the round-1
v120 output as prior; diff the two lineage-sharing legs.

| metric               | fresh-vs-incr (r1) | shared lineage |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| noise hunks          | 3,929              | **2,995**      |
| noise share of hunks | 67.2%              | 60.3%          |
| genuine-change hunks | 1,919              | 1,973          |
| rename occurrences   | 7,757              | 5,893          |
| lineage-leg cost     | —                  | 4m08s total    |

Chain-diff composition: transfer-gap 5,504 (93.4%), asymmetric 253,
reroll 136 — the mechanical buckets are at their floors; what recurs
is LLM naming instability on bindings that fail to transfer every run
(close-match remainders + the ambiguous-bucket fresh pool). Same-stem
decoration/case/ordinal flips: 704 occ / 220 pairs (11.9%), the
entire top of the list (`identityVar→identityVal` 34,
`appStateVal→appStateVar` 34, `RpcRequestSchema→rpcRequestSchema` 19).

**Fix: prior-name snapping (`80492a5`)** — suggestions snap to the
unique same-stem prior name before validation (function path:
`fn.priorVersionNames` stem index; module path: per-identifier
`suggestedName`). Ambiguous stems never snap.

**Chain re-measure with snapping** (`/tmp/exp016-chain2/`): noise
2,995 → 2,960 hunks; same-stem flips 704 → 677. Snapping fired only
where prior context exists — the autopsy of the surviving flips
(`identityItem→identityVal` 32) shows they are ROUND-2 RETRIES on
`q => q` identity arrows and similar structurally-identical clones:
fresh-pool functions in m:n ambiguous hash buckets with NO prior
context at all. The decoration churn is a SYMPTOM; the reservoir is
the disease.

## Remaining levers after snapping — with honest sizing

**Parent-key probe** (`probe-parent-keys.ts`): 16,725 members in 2,206
multi-member buckets; 3,507 unique under (hash, parentKey). BUT the
existing memberKey stage already resolves almost exactly that
population (memberKeyResolved 3,186 — extractMemberKey covers
prop/method/assign keys). The genuinely NEW evidence (functions passed
as arguments to member calls, `arg:transform@0`) is only **287
members** — not worth a fingerprint change alone.

So the reservoir's still-ambiguous ~4,400 are KEYLESS clones (identity
arrows in argument/array positions, bare declarators). Cracking them
needs a different evidence class:

1. **Occurrence-context hints as SOFT transfers**: bucket members can't
   be exactly paired, but their surrounding statement content (the
   rename-invariant hash of the ENCLOSING statement, like
   statement-align uses) is often unique — e.g.
   `inputFilterSensitiveLog: q => q` inside a distinctive options
   object. A (bucketHash, enclosingStatementHash) pairing is
   statement-align applied ACROSS functions instead of within a pair.
   Needs sizing.
2. Synonym drift on close-match remainders where no same-stem prior
   exists (`lastAssistantMessageHash→messageItem`) — per-identifier
   prior hints in FUNCTION prompts (the module prompt already renders
   per-identifier "Prior version name:" lines).
3. Asymmetric residue (253) — ambiguous-bucket wrong-twin transfers
   keeping minified tokens stable on one side only.

The goal bar ("review like a real git diff") needs noise well under
genuine (~1,900): from 2,960, the keyless-clone reservoir is the only
family big enough to close the gap.
