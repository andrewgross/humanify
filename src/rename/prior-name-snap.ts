/**
 * Snap LLM name suggestions to prior-version names.
 *
 * A close-matched function's prompt carries the prior code and names, but
 * the LLM freely re-decorates: `identityVal` becomes `identityVar`,
 * `config` becomes `configVar`, `RpcRequestSchema` becomes
 * `rpcRequestSchema` — same meaning, different surface, and every such
 * choice is a diff hunk against the prior release. When a suggestion
 * shares its STEM (name minus trailing Val/Var/Ref/…/digits decorations,
 * case-insensitive) with exactly ONE prior name, the prior name is the
 * right answer — reuse it verbatim.
 *
 * Precision guards: the stem must be non-empty and uniquely held by one
 * prior name (React95/React103/ink8 all stem to "react" — ambiguous,
 * never snapped); an exact prior-name suggestion passes through
 * untouched; validation still runs on the snapped name downstream.
 *
 * A stronger, exact-slot channel (A2) catches full synonym flips
 * (`caughtError` → `decisionOutcome`) that share no stem: when the exact
 * minified slot has a per-slot prior name that PASSED the upstream content
 * agreement gate (`priorNameSnaps`), that name is authoritative and the
 * suggestion snaps to it regardless of stem. The gate — the new binding's
 * definition still corroborates its prior counterpart — is what keeps a
 * genuinely repurposed binding from being snapped.
